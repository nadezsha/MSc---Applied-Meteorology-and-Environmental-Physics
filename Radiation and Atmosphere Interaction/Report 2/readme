how to run the model : 
uvspec <2a.inp> 2a.out
uvspec <2b.inp> 2b.out

2a.out contains: wavelength, direct horizontal irradiance, diffuse downward horizontal irradiance,diffuse upward horizontal irradiance (reflected), uavg
uavg: proportional to actinic flux (the radiation that a shpere receives). 
actinic flux = uavg * 4* pi
global irradiance on a horizontal surface (looking upwards, like a pyranometer) = direct + diffuse downward

2b.out contains: wavelength, direct horizontal irradiance, diffuse downward horizontal irradiance,diffuse upward horizontal irradiance (reflected), uavgdirect, 
uavgdiffuse downward,uavgdiffuse upward 
actinic flux = (uavgdirect + uavgdiffuse downward)  * 4* pi
global irradiance on a horizontal surface (looking upwards, like a pyranometer) = direct + diffuse downward



Homework: 
run the model for sza=10, 30, 40, 60, 80, 85 degrees. 
Use the following radiative transfer schemes: twostr, sdisort (4 streams), sdisort (8 streams), sdisort (16 streams)
calculate global irradiance and actinic flux.
Use sdisort (16 streams) as the reference. Calculate the percentage difference of the other schemes relatively to the reference for all wavelengths.
Make a figure of the percentage differences as a function of wavelength. Each figure should refer to one solar zenith 
angle and one radiative quantity (actinic flux or global irradiance) 

Total number of figures: 6 solar zenith angles X 2 radiative quantities =12 . Each figure should include 3 curves (twostr, sdisort4 and sdisort8 differeces 
relative to sdiort16)
