how to run the model : 
uvspec <4.inp> 4.out

4.out contains: wavelength, direct horizontal irradiance, diffuse downward horizontal irradiance,diffuse upward horizontal irradiance (reflected), uavgdirect, 
uavgdiffuse downward,uavgdiffuse upward 





Homework: 

PART 1:
run the model for sza=10, 40, 70 and 85 degrees. 
Change Angstrom b from 0 to 1, step 0.2
Use standard values for all other input parameters.

Use b=0 as a reference. Calculate the ratio of others relative to the reference for all wavelengths.
Make a figure of the ratios as a function of wavelength. Each figure should refer to one solar zenith 
angle and the following 3 radiative quantities: direct horizontal irradiance, diffuse downward horizontal irradiance, global horizontal irradiance 

Total number of figures: 4 solar zenith angles X 6 Angstrom b values = 24. 
Each figure should include 3 curves (rhe radiave quantities)

IMPORTANT NOTE: for multiple runs, check file "bat.bat"


PART 2:
run the model for sza=10, 40, 70 and 85 degrees. 
Change ssa from 0.65 to 0.95 step 0.1
Use standard values for all other input parameters.

Use ssa = 0.95 as a reference. Calculate the ratio of others relative to the reference for all wavelengths.
Make a figure of the ratios as a function of wavelength. Each figure should refer to one solar zenith 
angle and the following 3 radiative quantities: direct horizontal irradiance, diffuse downward horizontal irradiance, global horizontal irradiance 

Total number of figures: 4 solar zenith angles X 4 ssa values = 16. 
Each figure should include 3 curves (rhe radiave quantities)

IMPORTANT NOTE: for multiple runs, check file "bat.bat"


PART 3:
run the model for sza=10, 40, 70 and 85 degrees. 
Change gg from 0.5 to 0.9 step 0.2
Use standard values for all other input parameters.

Use gg = 0.7 as a reference. Calculate the ratio of others relative to the reference for all wavelengths.
Make a figure of the ratios as a function of wavelength. Each figure should refer to one solar zenith 
angle and the following 3 radiative quantities: direct horizontal irradiance, diffuse downward horizontal irradiance, global horizontal irradiance 

Total number of figures: 4 solar zenith angles X 3 gg values = 12. 
Each figure should include 3 curves (rhe radiave quantities)

PART 4:

Run set 1: 
Set spline 300 300 10
run the model for sza=10, 40, 70 and 85 degrees. 
Change ssa from 0.65 to 0.95 step 0.1
Change Angstrom b from 0 to 1, step 0.2



Run set 2: 
Set spline 900 900 10
run the model for sza=10, 40, 70 and 85 degrees. 
Change ssa from 0.65 to 0.95 step 0.1
Change Angstrom b from 0 to 1, step 0.2


FOR ALL RUN SETS:

Use standard values for all other input parameters.


For each solar zenith angle and for each ssa value, calculate the ratios:  
direct horizontal irradiance / diffuse downward horizontal irradiance 
direct horizontal irradiance / global horizontal irradiance
diffuse downward horizontal irradiance/ global horizontal irradiance

among the different Angstrom b values. Use b=0 as a reference


Make a figure of the ratios as a function of ssa. Each figure should refer to one solar zenith 
angle and one irradiance ratio for all b values 

Total number of figures: ~ 1.000.000  :)
